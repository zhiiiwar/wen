    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      The Chemistry Department at the University of Sulaimani was established in
      1968, but due to political turmoil in 1981, the department, along with the
      university, was moved to Erbil by the Iraqi government. The department was
      re-established at the University of Sulaimani in 1995 with limited
      resources and with the help of a group of hard-working staff. From 1995
      onwards, the department has been actively involved in many academic
      activities and research. The department has various research and teaching
      branches such as analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, organic
      chemistry, inorganic chemistry, petroleum chemistry, polymer chemistry,
      industrial chemistry, green and environmental chemistry, biochemistry, and
      nanoscience. The department is currently offering various degrees,
      including B.Sc. in Chemistry, high diplomas, M.Sc., and PhD. in all fields
      of chemistry.

    <h2>Department Vision:</h2>
    <p>
      The department of Chemistry at UOS is nationally and internationally
      recognized, and it is one of the top departments at the level of
      universities. The vision of the department is to generate knowledge and
      skills by applying new technologies to teaching. We are encouraging our
      students to contribute to society through teaching, training, and
      conducting active research. The department of Chemistry distinguishes
      itself by its strong cross-disciplinary collaborations both within and
      outside the university and country.
