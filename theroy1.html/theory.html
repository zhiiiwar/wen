    <h2>About Us:</h2>
    <p>
      Preparing competent professional graduates in various fields of science
      The College of Science was established at the University of Sulaimani in
      1968 which included Geology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, and Biology
      departments. Later, in 1981, the University of Sulaimani was moved to
      Erbil City following a political decision by the Baas Regime, and its name
      was changed to Salahaddin University. After the major uprising in 1991,
      the idea of re-establishing the University of Sulaimani by the Sulaimani
      citizens was seriously considered, and the Kurdistan Parliament issued a
      verdict in 1992 to re-establish the University of Sulaimani. The College
      of Science was opened in 1994 with the aid of several hard-working
      lecturers. The college started with only two departments, the departments
      of Geology and Mathematics, followed by the opening of other departments:
      Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and Computer sciences, with the support of
      the Kurdistan Regional Government. The number of lecturers has reached
      (218) so far; they hold Ph.D. and MSc degrees, and the number of students
      has risen from 98 students in 1998 to 8,397 at present for all six
      departments of the college. The number of students who have successfully
      graduated from this college with a BSc degree since its establishment is
      7,902 graduates.
